# Image2
Image Workbench for FreeCAD

Features:

* Loading images for use as reference in FreeCAD

* Creating image planes

* Scaling image planes to fit object dimensions

* Positioning and rotating image planes

* Setting transparency of the planes


Feature ideas:

* Image viewer

* Create image plane from rectangular part of image rather than the whole image

* Scaling image to fit object

* Rotate image to face normal


Issues:

* Change from Part2DObjectPython to a object directly from DocumentObject

* Translation

* Drawing line when scaling not working as it should

* Texture coordinates on image plane
